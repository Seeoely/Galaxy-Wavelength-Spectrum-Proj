After downloading data from the email. I used the command “more” to unpack data then selected 10 templates and organized into directories. I then copied data from each passband file and compiled it all into one, then uploaded it to Topcat and plotted the “PassbandResponseCurve.jpg”. To obtain the youngest and oldest spectra superimposed with the passbands, I used the code in the file “Magnify.c” to re-scale the spectra, then output each result to the files “youngest.txt” and “oldest.txt” respectively; I then used each as the input to Topcat to obtain the graphs in “youngest.jpg” and “oldest.jpg”. Next, in the file “EG.c”, I interpolated the passband curves to the same step-size as the spectra and multiplied each response by the flux of each model spectra, then integrated each result over the model spectra wavelengths. The results were then plugged into the AB magnitude equation to get each magnitude. The magnitudes got put into a file labeled “Mags.txt” then transferred to “Magnitudes.txt” in a cleaner format, done with the code in “CCdiagram.c”. To make the color-color diagrams, I subtracted the magnitudes of two passbands for the desired color, done with the code in “CCdiagram.c” and output two colors into a coordinate files labeled “u_g_r.txt” and “r_i_z.txt”; I then plugged those coordinates into Topcat to obtain the diagrams seen in “u_g_r.jpg” and “r_i_z.jpg”.
